# PUI Homework 7 by Pablo Mandiola (pmb434)

## Assignment 1

This assignment was about using GeoPandas to process spatial data and displaying maps. Shapely, Fiona and PySal were also used for some operations.

The analysis was about broadband access in New York City and its relation with LinkNYC stations location. For this, the data was spatially combined at the Public Use Microdata (PUMA) level, and gathered from LinkNYC, and the American Community Survey.
