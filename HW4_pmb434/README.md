# Homework 4

## Assignment 1

In this assignment, we had to visually show the Central Limit Theorem and the Law of Large Numbers using different distributions. For this we generated 100 random samples for 5 distributions (Chi Squared, Normal, Poisson, Binomial, and Geometric) and plotted the sample means in different ways to visualize how the theorems work. 

## Assignment 2

In this assignment, we had to think about a data-driven inference based on CitiBike data and write up the Null and Alternative Hypothesis. My idea was that Tourists might do longer trips in CitiBike than New Yorkers, because they are exploring the city and New Yorkers use them mostly to commute. We also had to download a month of data from CitiBike and prepare it for someone else to actually run the test.

## Assignment 3

[Jupyter Notebook with answers](HW4_3_pmb434.ipynb)

In this assignment, we had to finish a hypothesis testing we started on class. The test was about a new bus route, and whether it improved commuting time or not.
