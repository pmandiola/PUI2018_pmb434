## Review

**Clarity:** It is clear that the map is showing locations of HHCs across New York City, but there is no evident message the map is trying to convey. The legend is more confusing than useful, because it has only one label and it seems as if there is missing information. Finally, it would be helpful to indicate which geographic subdivision is being used if it is relevant for the analysis, otherwise it could be ommited.

**Esthetic:** Using a white background map with fine black borders is a good choice as it helps the viewer concentrate on the points, giving enough context and without unnecessary distraction. Bright blue color for the data points is also a good choice as it is easy to recognize it from the background.

**Honesty:** The plot does not make any unnecessary adjustments to the data in order to make a point, it justs shows the locations of the HHCs.
