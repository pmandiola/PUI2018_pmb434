# PUI Homework 8 by Pablo Mandiola (pmb434)

## Assignment 1

For this assignment I made a plot of Population Density in Santiago (Chile) by Census Block. The data is taken from the 2017 Census and downloaded from Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas (the Chilean agency in charge of the Census). The city boundary is taken from Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional.

The Jupyter Notebook was built to plot any city in Chile. However, for replication purposes I had to adjust it because CUSP ADRF doesn't have unrar installed, so it just works for Santiago as is. Based on the work in https://github.com/carnby/mapas_censo_2017 to understand the handling of Chilean census data and shapefiles.
