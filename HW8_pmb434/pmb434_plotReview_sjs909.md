![Santiago Density](https://github.com/pmandiola/PUI2018_pmb434/blob/master/HW8_pmb434/Santiago_density_by_Block.png)

CLARITY: The plot is very easy to read. You can see where the city center is based on density. Perhaps my only constructive feedback would be with regard to the legend. It is difficult to mentally breakdown the different intervals. it might have been beneficial to round the interval to more comprehensible whole numbers. But the position of the legend is good.

ESTHETIC: Very visually appealing graph! I checked for each type of color blindness, and you can still distinguish the differences between density amounts. Definitely beautiful in my subjective judgment. The darker areas are functional to communicate density and the shape of the area is interesting. 

HONESTY: Does not seem to deform the information at all. The borders of census tract might have some bias in how they are established, however this is not particularly relevant with regard to this plot.
