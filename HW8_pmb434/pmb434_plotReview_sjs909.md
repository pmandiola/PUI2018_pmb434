![Santiago Density](https://github.com/pmandiola/PUI2018_pmb434/blob/master/HW8_pmb434/Santiago_density_by_Block.png)

Very visually appealing graph! I checked for each type of color blindness, and you can still distinguish the differences between density amounts. 

Perhaps my only constructive feedback would be with regard to the legend. It is difficult to mentally breakdown the different intervals. it might have been beneficial to round the interval to more comprehensible whole numbers. But the position of the legend is good.
